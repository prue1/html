      <p>An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard
        apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the
        genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found.
        Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European
        colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and
        European Christian tradition.

    <div class="more_msg">
      <p>The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most economically
        significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
      <p>The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The
        introduction of the pineapple plant to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of
        luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations.
      </p>
      <p>Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple
        fruit. The plant normally propagates from the offset produced at the top of the fruit or from a side
        shoot, and typically matures within a year.</p>

      <p>A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit).</p>

      <p>Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, such as the sweet Prunus avium and the
        sour Prunus cerasus. The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied
        to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in "ornamental cherry" or "cherry
        blossom." Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although Prunus
        avium is often referred to specifically by the name "wild cherry" in the British Isles.</p>
